        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <br>
        Make sure to follow these rules so you don't get banned!<br>
        <br>
        1. Make sure your posts are interesting (no posting a circle<br>
        or a bucket, that's not interesting)<br>
        2. Don't post too much. Try to regulate yourself to at most,<br>
        3 posts a day. I can delete everything.<br>
        3. Do not post political statements that may make people<br>
        angry, or posts that spark heated debate. (At 2 statements,<br>
        I will delete your account.)<br>
        4. Have fun!
